# Music and motion

*[Embodied music cognition studies the role of the human body in music cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_music_cognition)*


Music, as temporal art, can suggest motion. Through manipulations of velocities and pitch contours, it can evoke associations of the movements of objects through space. This has been used regularly by composers as programmatic aspect of their composiitions. Rimsky-Korsakov's "Flight of the Bumblebee" is an easy example. Carl Stalling's Looney Tunes scores are another (though they reinforce visual motion).

*how? i don't really know - i'm not a psychologist. ecological/evolutionary: loudness, doppler  effect, simple cognitive mapping spatial direction up/down and pitch, reinforced by tradition music notation that plots pitch in the vertical dimenion*

Music also inspire motion in the body. It has always been closely tied to dance. The human body becomes a mediator between physical sound and mental models of musical structure. *entrainment/groove* *physical/mental gesture* Short of outright dancing, music can provoke kinesthetic sensations. *how do i back this up: bring theory of embodied music cognition* . Kinesthesis is the perception of body movements.

My composition Surge::Dart::Drift asks the question "What kind of subjective kinesthetic experiences can acoustic instrumental music provoke when it doesn't rely on discrete pitch structures and groove?"
