# The Role of Embodiment in the Perception of Music
## Introduction
* goal: review current research in *embodied music cognition* (emc)
* embodied cognition puts the emphasis on the role of the *human body as mediator for meaning formation*
* can be seen as "grounded cognition" or "extended cognition"
  * *grounded cognition* - concepts are grounded in sensorimotor networks
  * *extended cognition* - when humans use technology to "reach out" into env
* emc implies motor system, gestures, body movements have important role in music percepeiton
* central idea: an intentional level of musical interaction is established through *corporeal articualtions and imitations* of sensed physical information provided by the musical environment
* trend to broaden perspective - links to musical affect research, wellbeing, music engineering, brain studies
  * needs to that show embodiment plays a core role in an interconnected network of cognitive and emotive functions
* trend to narrow, strengthen -  strong effect of music perception on bodily behavior
  * needs to show embodiment is more than just an effect of music on action / the effect of action on music perception is essential in making sense of music

## Understanding Encoding and Decoding of Musical Expressiveness in Relation to Embodiment
```musical expression isn't everything | what is musical expressiveness? decoding sound into expressive gesture <- theres something in that```
* embodiment assumes the existence of *mirroring* processes that facilitate
  *  the *encoding* of expressive gestures into sounds
  *  the *decoding* of sounds into expressive gestures.
* *expressive gestures* are the common basis on which humans base their sense-giving engagment with music
* the underlying mechanamisms for musical meaning formation are rooted in *sensorimotor principles*
* conversely, music-driven gesturing may facilitate musical perception
* decoding involves actions - to capture the fdynamic flow of music and to facilitate the prediction of its expressive development
* studies at ipem led to several constructs of gesture types, such as *elementary gestures*, *basic gestures*, *gesture repertoires/repositories*, *expressive-supporting gestures*, *sound-producing gestures*, *expressive-responding gestures*
* *elementary gesture* - study addressed expresive gesturing while listening to guqin music.
  * listeners had certain commanilities in movements
  * listeners don't reflect sound producing gestures, but tend to reflect the expression-supporting gestures of the player's shoulders.
