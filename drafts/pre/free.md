chaos and instability

playing an instrument requres a careful coordination of subtle muscle movements. through years of training, the performer develops muscle memory. with a combination of forces, the player produces a "good" tone. this tone is predictable, consistent and intentional.mwhat happens when we relax those constraints, when we release a degree of control? sounds become less predictable and more unstable. there is wider sound world available to the composer.

as an example, consider the technique involved in producing sound with a bow on a double bass.
