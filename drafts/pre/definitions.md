**component**: 

**entropy**: a thermodynamic quantity representing the unavailability of a system's thermal energy for conversion into mechanical work, often interpreted as the degree of disorder or randomness in the system

**inertia**: a property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless that state is changed by an external force

**jerk**: the rate of change of acceleration

**kinetic energy**: the work needed to accelerate a body of a given mass from rest to its stated velocity

**kinematics**: a branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the mass of each or the forces that caused the motion.

**potential energy**:  the energy possessed by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factor

**torque**: rotational force
